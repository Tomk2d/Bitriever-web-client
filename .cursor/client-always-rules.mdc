# Client Development Rules
1. All CSS and design elements must be managed separately in .css files. Never control them directly in tsx or ts files.
2. Before creating a new file, always check the existing directory structure, files, and components. Aim to reuse existing components and code.
3. Manage every component separately. Do not create components repeatedly within a single file; separate them by component for reusability.
4. When writing code to communicate with the server, make sure to check and connect to the API provided by app-server.
5. The client must be developed to be fully responsive. Build the UI so that it adapts responsively rather than using fixed positions. Our base development reference is 1440 x 900.
6. If a component overlaps or breaks when the screen is reduced, implement clipping (overflow: hidden) so that the screen is cut off rather than allowing components to overlap or scroll.
7. Maintain horizontal layout at all screen sizes. Do not change from horizontal to vertical layout (no flex-wrap, no stacking elements vertically). Components should always remain in a horizontal row regardless of screen size.
8. When implementing responsive spacing: keep internal spacing within components fixed (e.g., gap between items inside a navigation menu). For spacing between major sections/components, set a minimum gap value. When the screen cannot be reduced further without going below the minimum gap, allow content to overflow off-screen instead of reducing spacing below the minimum.
